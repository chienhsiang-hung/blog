In this app, one of the most useful functions is street view images. Since these pictures aren’t be updated simultaneously, just by tapping the button, you can see the workers on the street are repairing the traffic light which has already been completed a few months ago.

There is a woman used it to track her own broken marriage. By searching her address, she saw her house, her pet, her car is on the driveway because there is no garage in that house and the tree her husband just pruned when they haven’t arrived the divorce stage yet.
