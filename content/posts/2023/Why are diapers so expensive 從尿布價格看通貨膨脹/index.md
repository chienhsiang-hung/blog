## News
According to the news [Coalition of Parent and Community Organizations Accuse Procter & Gamble of Price Gouging in Letter to CEO Jon Moeller About Skyrocketing Diaper Costs - ParentsTogether Action](https://parentstogetheraction.org/2022/09/19/open-letter-from-parents-to-procter-gamble-ceo/#:~:text=The%20overall%20cost%20of%20diapers,to%20keep%20their%20babies%20dry) - An open letter from parents to Procter & Gamble CEO. The letter is about the overall cost of diapers and how it is becoming increasingly difficult for parents to keep their babies dry. The letter states that the cost of diapers has increased by 50% in the last 10 years, and that the average family spends $936 per year on diapers.
### Why is the cost of diapers increasing so much?
According to a [CNN Business](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/23/business/diaper-costs-families-poverty/index.html) article, commodity prices have been rising due to high demand for products, supply-chain disruptions, and surging shipping costs. All these price hikes are now coming home to roost — in consumers’ wallets. Rising prices for diapers come as millions of US families grapple with the economic effects of the pandemic. 

Another reason for the increase in diaper prices is inflation. It happens when there is an increase in the money supply without an equivalent rise in the demand for goods or services. If this happens on a large scale, then prices will rise and become more expensive to make. This affects the pricing of diapers as well[^¹].

In addition to the reasons mentioned above, there are a few other factors contributing to the increase in diaper prices. One of them is the cost of raw materials used to make diapers. The main materials used in the production of disposable diapers are pulp and plastic. The prices of these materials have been increasing due to supply chain disruptions and increased demand from other industries.

Another factor is the cost of manufacturing and transportation. The pandemic has caused disruptions in manufacturing and transportation, leading to higher costs for companies. This includes the cost of labor, energy, and transportation. These increased costs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.

Finally, marketing and advertising expenses can also contribute to the overall cost of diapers. Companies spend a significant amount of money on advertising and marketing to promote their products and brand, which can add to the cost of the product.

Overall, the increase in diaper prices is likely due to a combination of factors, including rising commodity prices, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and increased manufacturing and transportation costs.

It is important for companies to work towards managing costs while maintaining quality and accessibility of their products for consumers. Hopefully, as the global economy stabilizes and supply chains improve, the cost of diapers and other products will become more affordable for families.
