## Update Sharepoint List Item Choice Column
**Power Automate - Microsoft Forms & SharePoint choice field (multi-select) updates**

You can update the choice list item by this:
{{< youtube wX1TVWedVGA >}}

### TL;DW
Make sure you can generate the following `cell value`/`item`:
```
{
  "Value": "<iterated item>"
}
```
But like [Destroyzer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoKVtS-C2ON7pP9MxXB5-NQ) mentioned:
> the items is added on my list in this way:
> 
> {"Value":"Desvio em processo"}{"Value":"Desvio em relat√≥rio"}

or it will show like `@variable('YourArrayVariable')` literally when you try to add it manually. We just can't add the arr variable to the PA connector by **Dynamic Content**. Why?

### Solution
It turned out it's the column setting in the Sharepoint List was wrong. Make sure you've selected the **Allow multiple selections** in the advanced setting of the choices column.

Then you can go back to your Power Automate flow. You'll see the input box changed. Then you clicked on the icon shown below to *switch to input entire array mode*.

Vola! Now you can add the array variable you created before to the choice column.
