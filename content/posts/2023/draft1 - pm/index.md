## What's a PM
### What's a PM?
A PM is someone responsible to make sure a team ship great products, 
like a mini CEO who draws vision, designs a strategy and makes decisions.
> The difference between a chief executive and a product manager is product managers don't have authority over the teams.

For the team, a PM is the advocate of the customer.
### How do you lead a team without authority?
You will need to influence them with your vision and research. Don't be afraid of anyone or anything as long as you know that you are doing the right thing. 
### Why PM?
One reason is that you get to sit at the intersection of Technology, Business, and Design and learn to see things from a different perspective of view.

## Functions of a PM
*(Why -> What -> How -> Test -> Deploy)*
|                     Why, What                   |   How  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Define the requirements and Research the market | Design |
### Why&What - Research and Planning
1. Try to identify the problems and set a set of features to achieve the goal and answer the question "why are we working on this?".
2. Define Success. What the world would look like if the team gets successful? Objectives and Key Results (OKRs).

> For example. There is an idea to build a talent/service matching website (for plumbers etc.).

Pain Points:
- Provider: It is expensive to find customers through PRO360 (100ish NTD a time).
- User: 
  1. No way to browse. (Can't initiate the purchases.)
  2. Hard to find the services nearby.
