## Case
*[Architecture Strategy: Federal Finance Agency Practice Case](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-bYDsnRg4lzUpmVXavqS8jR_mGGeagFMj63du50PQOo/edit) from [Deloitte]() and [Christine Wong](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChristineWong).*
### Architecture Strategy: Federal Finance Agency
**Our client is a small division of a large Federal Finance Agency that is in charge of administering and enforcing economic and trade sanctions determined by US foreign policy and national security goals.**

#### BUSINESS SITUATION

The agency’s office uses a number of software application systems to track and manage cases, applications, transactions, and other financial documents. Recently, the division has experienced increased workload due to changes in US foreign policy as well as high staff turnover. The change in US foreign policy and high staff turnover has led to a substantial backlog of unprocessed paperwork.

In addition, the organization’s business units are extremely siloed; each section of the organization has its own separate software application and database which creates redundant data in the system. The current systems used at this office are a mixture of in-house solutions and legacy systems developed by other contractors years ago. The organization wants to consolidate its systems to increase collaboration, streamline operations, and improve efficiency.

  

#### PROBLEM STATEMENT

An enterprise architecture plan is an overall structural strategy for all IT systems in an organization. This plan combines the business needs of key stakeholders to help an organization achieve its future goals. The officials of this agency have outlined the need for an overall structural strategy for all IT systems within their organization. Deloitte has been hired to assist with the analysis of the current systems and develop an implementation plan for a new, shared enterprise architecture solution spanning across all divisions of the organization.
