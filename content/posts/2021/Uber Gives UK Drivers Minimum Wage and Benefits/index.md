Weeks ago, Uber in the UK announced that all drivers (around 70,000 people) will be treated as full-time employed employees from now. That means they have holiday pay, minimum wage protections, and trip requests, etc.

# Uber in the other countries?  
It’s likely that the other counties Uber drivers are going to request the same benefits and then furthermore affect the local taxi industry.  
For instance, if Uber in Taiwan follows the policy, the local taxi companies (55688, Taiwan Taxi co.) are probably facing their drivers changing their career master to serve. On the side of Uber Taiwan, it’s probably going to raise their price due to the rising cost of employment. In the end, all the costs still depend on the consumer’s pockets. Then that leads to a decrease in demand, some drivers might be going to suffer from unemployment.  
Considering the Hand in the free capital market, price tends to stay on an equilibrium spot, maybe all this ‘price going up’, ‘drivers losing jobs’ won’t even happen in the first place.  
And this makes me couldn’t help but think of an interesting result, and that is more likely to happen — Uber drivers in the other countries near the UK might flow into the UK for a better working environment.
